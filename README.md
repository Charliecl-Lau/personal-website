### A project repository built using the BMad Method framework and Google Stitch AI.

## Project Overview
This application isn’t just a simple portfolio; it’s a living showcase of a modern, agent-driven development lifecycle. It demonstrates the power of bridging the gap between raw ideation and production-ready UI in record time by leveraging advanced AI frameworks.

## The Planning Phase: The BMad Method
To ensure a structured and robust foundation, this project was architected using the **BMad (Brainstorming, Modeling, Analysis, Design)** framework, utilizing specialized AI agents for each phase:

*   **Brainstorming Agent**: Used to exhaustively explore the project scope, identify potential edge cases, and clearly define the "North Star" vision of the application.
*   **UX Specialist Agent**: Translated abstract high-level ideas into a concrete UX Specification, defining detailed user flows, information hierarchy, and accessibility requirements.
*   **Tech Writer Agent**: Standardized the technical documentation and ensured the project architecture was clearly articulated, creating a seamless handover for implementation.

## The Design Phase: Google Stitch
Transitioning from "Agentic Planning" to "Visual Reality" was accelerated using **Google Stitch**.

*   **Concept**: Once the UX Specification was finalized by the BMad agents, Google Stitch was used to instantly convert those rigorous requirements into high-fidelity UI designs.
*   **Efficiency**: Stitch provided the initial scaffolding, allowing the development process to completely skip the "blank canvas" phase. This enabled a focus on refining interactions and logic rather than writing boilerplate layout code.

## Technical Stack
*   **Frontend**: React (TypeScript) + Vite
*   **Styling**: Vanilla CSS (Custom Design System)
*   **Methodology**: BMad Framework
*   **Design Acceleration**: Google Stitch AI
