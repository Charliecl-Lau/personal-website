# Product Brief: Personal_Website

**Date:** 2025-12-12
**Author:** Charlie

---

## Executive Summary

Personal_Website is a modern, bright digital portfolio designed to bridge the gap between standard professional profiles and the true depth of Charlie's engineering capabilities. It serves a dual purpose: a live demonstration of web development skills and a dedicated platform for hosting detailed technical projects (specifically engineering reports and CAD drawings) that platforms like LinkedIn cannot adequately display. The goal is to impress recruiters not just with skills, but with personality and authenticity.

---

## Core Vision

### Problem Statement
Standard professional networks (LinkedIn, resume portfolios) are rigid and impersonal. They fail to capture the full depth of complex engineering work—such as detailed CAD drawings and bookshelf speaker reports—and offer no space to demonstrate the candidate's unique personality or self-introduction in a creative way.

### Problem Impact
Recruiters see a "candidate profile" rather than a whole person. Technical depth is lost in generic file attachments, and the candidate blends into the sea of other applicants, missing the chance to make a memorable, human connection before the interview even starts.

### Why Existing Solutions Fall Short
*   **LinkedIn/Resumes:** Limit content to text and simple media; poor handling of large technical reports.
*   **Generic Portfolios:** Often sterile and template-based, lacking the "bright" and "modern" personal touch.

### Proposed Solution
A custom-built, personality-first website that combines:
1.  **Self-Introduction Flow:** A narrative-driven "About Me" section that establishes a human connection.
2.  **Technical Depth:** A dedicated project showcase capable of displaying heavy engineering documentation (CAD, reports) in an engaging way.
3.  **Modern Aesthetics:** A "bright, modern" design that stands out visually.

### Key Differentiators
*   **Personality x Precision:** The unique blend of an engineering mindset (detailed reports) with a creative, human-centric presentation.
*   **The Medium is the Message:** The website itself is a project, demonstrating the ability to build and execute, not just talk about plans.

<!-- Content will be appended sequentially through collaborative workflow steps -->

## MVP Scope

### Core Features (The "Must-Haves")
1.  **Landing Page (The "Hook"):**
    *   Modern, bright "Hero" section with self-introduction.
    *   "About Me" narrative flow.
    *   Project Grid/Gallery (Thumbnails + Titles) to drive navigation.
2.  **Project Detail Sub-pages (The "Depth"):**
    *   Dedicated URL for each project (e.g., `/projects/bookshelf-speakers`).
    *   **Content Layout:** "Article Style" layout to display the Engineering Report (Sections for Problem, Solution, Process) interspersed with high-quality images/renders.
    *   **Navigation:** Clear "Back to Home" or "Next Project" links to keep them browsing.
3.  **Contact/Footer:** Simple way to get in touch (Email/LinkedIn link).

### Out of Scope for MVP (Phase 2)
*   **Interactive 3D Viewers:** We will use static high-quality renders for now (faster to build, less technical risk for MVP).
*   **CMS / Admin Panel:** Content will be hardcoded or markdown-based; no login system for Charlie to edit content dynamically.
*   **Blog:** Focus is strictly on Portfolio Projects first.

### MVP Success Criteria
*   **Functionality:** Users can navigate from Home -> Project -> Home without confusion.
*   **Performance:** Images appeal "Premium" but load fast (Mobile optimized).
*   **Content:** The "Bookshelf Speaker" report is fully readable as a web page, not just a PDF link.

### Future Vision
*   **Interactive 3D:** Embedding WebGL viewers to let users rotate the CAD models directly in the browser.
*   **Technical Blog:** Expanding into tutorials or thoughts on engineering/tech.


## Success Metrics

### Business Objectives (Personal ROI)
1.  **Quality over Quantity:** Success is not 100 spam emails, but getting **"The Right Emails"**—inquiries from hiring managers who specifically mention the bookshelf speaker report or the website quality.
2.  **Skill Mastery (The Meta-Goal):** Successfully executing this project by treating AI agents as true collaborative partners/colleagues, thereby improving personal Project Management capabilities.

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
*   **Retention (The "Hook"):** Average Session Duration **> 1:30 minutes**.
    *   *Why:* This proves we successfully transitioned the recruiter from the "30-second mobile scan" to "deep reading mode."
*   **Conversion:** Receiving interview requests that reference specific portfolio details.
*   **Process Execution:** Completion of the full BMad lifecycle (Analysis -> Planning -> Implementation) without skipping steps, demonstrating discipline in AI-assisted development.


## Target Users

### Primary Users: "The Mobile Recruiter"
*   **Role:** Hiring Manager or Tech Recruiter scanning dozens of applicants.
*   **Context:** Mobile-first. Likely viewing the link from a phone while commuting or quickly filtering candidates between meetings.
*   **Constraint:** **The 30-Second Rule.** Time-poor.
*   **Pain Point:** Seeing a resume *without* work experience. They need immediate, visual proof of capability to bridge that gap.
*   **Goal:** To find a "Signal in the Noise." They are looking for one standout reason to interview a candidate who lacks traditional work history.
*   **Success Vision:** They open the link on their phone, see a "bright, modern" intro that feels professional, and instantly understand "This person can BUILD."

### Secondary Users: "The Network & Peers"
*   **Role:** Fellow engineers, classmates, or industry connections.
*   **Motivation:** Genuine interest in the specific engineering topics (e.g., bookshelf speaker design).
*   **Goal:** To learn from the detailed reports or see the CAD drawings for technical utility.

### User Journey (The 30-Second Conversion)
1.  **Discovery:** Recruiter clicks link on resume/LinkedIn via iPhone.
2.  **The Hook (0-5s):** "Modern, Bright" landing page loads instantly. A creative "About Me" flow introduces Charlie's personality immediately (not just text).
3.  **The Proof (5-30s):** They scroll to "Projects." They don't read the report yet; they see *visuals*—renders of the speakers, snippets of code. It looks premium.
4.  **The "Aha!" Moment:** They realize, "This isn't just a student; this is a Builder."
5.  **Retention:** They bookmark the site to view the detailed PDF report on their desktop later, or forward the link to a technical lead.
